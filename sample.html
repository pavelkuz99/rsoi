                <h2>Amsterdam</h2>
                <p>Amsterdam is the Netherlands’ capital, known for its artistic heritage, elaborate canal system and
                    narrow houses with gabled facades, legacies of the city’s 17th-century Golden Age. Its Museum
                    District houses the Van Gogh Museum, works by Rembrandt and Vermeer at the Rijksmuseum, and modern
                    art at the Stedelijk. Cycling is key to the city’s character, and there are numerous bike paths.</p>

                <p>Malaga is a port city on southern Spain’s Costa del Sol, known for its high-rise hotels and resorts
                    jutting up from yellow-sand beaches. Looming over that modern skyline are the city’s 2 massive
                    hilltop citadels, the Alcazaba and ruined Gibralfaro, remnants of Moorish rule. The city's soaring
                    Renaissance cathedral is nicknamed La Manquita ('one-armed lady') because one of its towers was
                    curiously left unbuilt.</p>

                <h2>London</h2>
                <p>London, the capital of England and the United Kingdom, is a 21st-century city with history stretching
                    back to Roman times. At its centre stand the imposing Houses of Parliament, the iconic ‘Big Ben’
                    clock tower and Westminster Abbey, site of British monarch coronations. Across the Thames River, the
                    London Eye observation wheel provides panoramic views of the South Bank cultural complex, and the
                    entire city.</p>
